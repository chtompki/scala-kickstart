# Scala Kickstart

Welcome to Scala Kickstart! This is a project to teach you some basic [Scala](http://scala-lang.org). If you never used Scala before, this is a good start for you.

## Preparations

Before you get started you need the Scala compiler and [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) (a Scala build tool comparable to [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org) or [Gradle](http://gradle.com)).
You can either follow the instructions on the [Scala](http://scala-lang.org/download/) and [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html) website or depending on your OS do one of the following:

- MacOS: `brew install scala sbt`
- Linux: `sudo apt-get install scala sbt`
- Windows: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Furthermore you'll need a text editor for writing Scala code.
There are plugins for all the major IDE's.
We recommend the use of [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

To compile the project run `sbt compile`. To run all tests run `sbt test`.

If you want to create your own playground project instead of using this one, you can simply run:

```
sbt new scala/scala-seed.g8
```

It will create a new minimal Scala project for you.

## Assignments

I want to...

- learn how to do typical Java Stuff in Scala, have a look at the [java2scala assignment](/docs/java2scala.md)
- learn how to work with Scala collections, have a look at the [scala collections assignment](/docs/scala-collections.md)

## Learn more

- [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1) by Martin Odersky on coursera
- [Scala courses](http://underscore.io/training/) by [underscore.io](http://underscore.io)
